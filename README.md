It took me about four days over two occassion to complete the scene. 
I really enjoyed the fact how quickly one can model a space with objects, lights and how characteristics of shadows make the scene appear very alive.
The biggest challenge was the animation of the globe as it took an extensive amount of time to understand it and then to make it work.
